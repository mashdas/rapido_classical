# rapido_classical:
A model with score 0.863 has been created.Although per id model gives a score of 1,it's not efficient to create a model per id.
Check augment_beta for per id classification.
Using the functions,data has been pruned and augmented.The data here is of "Sunday" only,as such the name sunday_classifier.
Using the same model and functions, classifiers can be created for the other 6 days.I'm not gonna do it because my PC has it's
limits.

PS-For the Full project,i might do it on someone else's account.
